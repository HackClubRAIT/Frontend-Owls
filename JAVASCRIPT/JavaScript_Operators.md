# JavaScript Operators:
####JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands.

#### There are following types of operators in JavaScript.

* Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison (Relational) Operators
* Bitwise Operators
- Logical Operators
* Assignment Operators
- Special Operators

## JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on the operands. The following operators are known as JavaScript arithmetic operators.  

|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|+|	Addition|10+20 = 30|
|- |Subtraction	|20-10 = 10|
|* |Multiplication|	10*20 = 200|
|/|Division	|20/10 = 2|
|%|Modulus (Remainder)|20%10 = 0|
|++|Increment|var a=10; a++; Now a = 11|
|--|Decrement|var a=10; a--; Now a = 9|

## JavaScript Comparison Operators
The JavaScript comparison operator compares the two operands. The comparison operators are as follows:


|Operator|	Description|	Example|
|---|---|---|
|==|	Is equal to|	10==20 = false|
|===|	Identical (equal and of same type)|	10==20 = false|
|!=|	Not equal to|	10!=20 = true|
|!==|	Not Identical|	20!==20 = false|
|>	|Greater than	|20>10 = true|
|>=|	Greater than or equal to|	20>=10 = true|
|<|	Less than|	20<10 = false|
|<=|	Less than or equal to|	20<=10 = false|



## JavaScript Bitwise Operators
The bitwise operators perform bitwise operations on operands. The bitwise operators are as follows:

|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|&|	Bitwise AND| (10 == 20 & 20 == 33) = false|
| \|  |	Bitwise OR|	(10 == 20 \| 20 == 33) = false|
|^|	Bitwise XOR|	(10 == 20 ^ 20 == 33) = false|
|~|	Bitwise NOT|	(~10) = -10|
|<<|	Bitwise Left Shift|	(10<<2) = 40|
|>>|	Bitwise Right Shift|	(10>>2) = 2|
|>>>|	Bitwise Right Shift with Zero|	(10>>>2) = 2|


## JavaScript Logical Operators
The following operators are known as JavaScript logical operators.

|Operator|	Description|	Example|
|---|---|---|
|&&|	Logical AND|	(10 == 20 && 20 == 33) = false|
|\|\| |	Logical OR|	(10 == 20 \|\| 20 == 33) = false|
|!|	Logical Not	|!(10 == 20) = true|
