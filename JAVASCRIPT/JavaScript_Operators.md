# JavaScript Operators:
JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands.

#### There are following types of operators in JavaScript.

* Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison (Relational) Operators
* Bitwise Operators
- Logical Operators
* Assignment Operators
- Special Operators

## JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on the operands. The following operators are known as JavaScript arithmetic operators.  

| Operator | Description         | Example                   |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| +        | Addition            | 10+20 = 30                |
| -        | Subtraction         | 20-10 = 10                |
| *        | Multiplication      | 10*20 = 200               |
| /        | Division            | 20/10 = 2                 |
| %        | Modulus (Remainder) | 20%10 = 0                 |
| ++       | Increment           | var a=10; a++; Now a = 11 |
| --       | Decrement           | var a=10; a--; Now a = 9  |

## JavaScript Comparison Operators
The JavaScript comparison operator compares the two operands. The comparison operators are as follows:


| Operator | Description                        | Example         |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
| ==       | Is equal to                        | 10==20 = false  |
| ===      | Identical (equal and of same type) | 10==20 = false  |
| !=       | Not equal to                       | 10!=20 = true   |
| !==      | Not Identical                      | 20!==20 = false |
| >        | Greater than                       | 20>10 = true    |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to           | 20>=10 = true   |
| <        | Less than                          | 20<10 = false   |
| <=       | Less than or equal to              | 20<=10 = false  |



## JavaScript Bitwise Operators
The bitwise operators perform bitwise operations on operands. The bitwise operators are as follows:

| Operator | Description                   | Example                        |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| &        | Bitwise AND                   | (10 == 20 & 20 == 33) = false  |
| \|       | Bitwise OR                    | (10 == 20 \| 20 == 33) = false |
| ^        | Bitwise XOR                   | (10 == 20 ^ 20 == 33) = false  |
| ~        | Bitwise NOT                   | (~10) = -10                    |
| <<       | Bitwise Left Shift            | (10<<2) = 40                   |
| >>       | Bitwise Right Shift           | (10>>2) = 2                    |
| >>>      | Bitwise Right Shift with Zero | (10>>>2) = 2                   |


## JavaScript Logical Operators
The following operators are known as JavaScript logical operators.

| Operator | Description | Example                          |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| &&       | Logical AND | (10 == 20 && 20 == 33) = false   |
| \|\|     | Logical OR  | (10 == 20 \|\| 20 == 33) = false |
| !        | Logical Not | !(10 == 20) = true               |


## JavaScript Assignment Operators
The following operators are known as JavaScript assignment operators.

| Operator | Description         | Example                      |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| =        | Assign              | 10+10 = 20                   |
| +=       | Add and assign      | var a=10; a+=20; Now a = 30  |
| -=       | Subtract and assign | var a=20; a-=10; Now a = 10  |
| *=       | Multiply and assign | var a=10; a*=20; Now a = 200 |
| /=       | Divide and assign   | var a=10; a/=2; Now a = 5    |
| %=       | Modulus and assign  | var a=10; a%=2; Now a = 0    |

## JavaScript Special Operators
The following operators are known as JavaScript special operators.

| Operator   | Description                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \(?:\ )    | Conditional Operator returns value based on the condition. It is like if-else.  |
| ,          | Comma Operator allows multiple expressions to be evaluated as single statement. |
| delete     | Delete Operator deletes a property from the object.                             |
| in         | In Operator checks if object has the given property                             |
| instanceof | checks if the object is an instance of given  type                               |
| new        | creates an instance (object)                                                    |
| typeof     | checks the type of object.                                                      |
| void       | it discards the expression's return value.                                      |
| yield      | checks what is returned in a generator by the generator's iterator.             |
