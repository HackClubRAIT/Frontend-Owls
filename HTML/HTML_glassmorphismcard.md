# HTML glassmorphism Card
Glassmorphism is a design type that makes use of background transparency and a blur effect to create a glassy effect. Companies like Microsoft and google use this to make their websites attractive and elegant. If you want to implement this type of effect in a card you need to follow some easy steps and get your desired results.

Get started with any code editors and use the .html extension to create a file where you can write your code. Write the following code to get the basic structure of your card.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Glassmorphism effect</title>
</head>
<body>
    <img class="shape" src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ui.glass/shape.svg" alt="">
    <!-- code goes here -->
</body>
</html>

```

Now we have to add the card where we will apply glassmorphism effect.

```
<div class="card">
    <h3 class="card-title">Hey there!! Welcome</h3>
    <p>You can add description here</p>
    <a href="https://ui.glass">Read more</a>
</div>

```
