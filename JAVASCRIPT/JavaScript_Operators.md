# JavaScript Operators:
JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands.

#### There are following types of operators in JavaScript.

* Arithmetic Operators
- Comparison (Relational) Operators
* Bitwise Operators
- Logical Operators
* Assignment Operators
- Special Operators

## JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on the operands. The following operators are known as JavaScript arithmetic operators.  

|Operator|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|+|	Addition|10+20 = 30|
|- |Subtraction	|20-10 = 10|
|* |Multiplication|	10*20 = 200|
|/|Division	|20/10 = 2|
|%|Modulus (Remainder)|20%10 = 0|
|++|Increment|var a=10; a++; Now a = 11|
|--|Decrement|var a=10; a--; Now a = 9|

## JavaScript Comparison Operators
The JavaScript comparison operator compares the two operands. The comparison operators are as follows:


|Operator|	Description|	Example|
|---|---|---|
|==|	Is equal to|	10==20 = false|
|===|	Identical (equal and of same type)|	10==20 = false|
|!=|	Not equal to|	10!=20 = true|
|!==|	Not Identical|	20!==20 = false|
|>	|Greater than	|20>10 = true|
|>=|	Greater than or equal to|	20>=10 = true|
|<|	Less than|	20<10 = false|
|<=|	Less than or equal to|	20<=10 = false|
